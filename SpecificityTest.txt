Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is a video game developed by Nintendo, a video game company, where many of Nintendo's characters and third party characters brawl it out. The game was launched on December 8, 2018, and has since solid over 70 million copies. The game features 90 playable characters and 100 stages to play on. Characters include the iconic Mario and Luigi, Pikachu, and Kirby, and lesser known characters like Fox McCloud and Captain Falcon. The game can be played by up to 8 people.
The game is designed to be fun for all skill levels, but is has an underlying complexity that gives the game an incredibly high skill ceiling. This has garned a sizeable community that plays the game competitively. In Victoria, tournaments are held weekly and can have 30 to 50 people attend. The Victoria is friendly and welcoming, and all are welcome to join. A player named Machu is the undisputed best on the island, and he often travels internationally to compete in the game. Other fearsome players include Efeo, Ryn, Lam, Furaze, Whisdom, Cook, and Odii. Of these, Furaze distinguishes himself as the next most formidable on the island. Furaze often defeats the others effortlessly, and has an extremely exciting style.
Odii often has the best players gather in his two-room apartment to play for hours, trying to hone their skills. Odii's generosity has been a major factor in the improvement of the Victoria scene, which has started to overshadow other regions on Vancouver Island. The main tournament organizer, or TO, is Brady "Chang" Chan. Brady recently moved to Victoria and has since hosted two major tournaments and increased attendance of the Victoria tournaments greatly. He uses extra capital from the tournaments to create incentives for non-Victoria players to travel, and Victoria players to show up.
